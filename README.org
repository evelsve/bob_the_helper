"Bob the Helper" app was developed by Eva Elzbieta Sventickaite and Kris Farrugia.
Bob the Helper was inspired by Bob the Builder. The app is intended for children (7-10).

Intention was to make it as intuitive as possible from interactional point of view. 
Also, we wish to improve it even after the DS course, as a small continuous project.

Instructions:
Open the app, it will prompt you.

At most points in ROOT and dm1 you can quit the app by saying "quit", "turn off" or something similar. 
Same goes for "help".
